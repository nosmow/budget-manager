## Project description

Task Manager is a web application designed to help users organize their daily tasks efficiently. It allows users to create categories, add tasks within those categories, set due dates for tasks, and receive daily reminders via WhatsApp about upcoming tasks. Additionally, it offers a quick view of tasks created in the last two days on the main page and displays a graph representing the number of tasks created in the last five months.

### Essential features

- **Category Creation:** Users can create custom categories to organize their tasks effectively, such as work, study, personal, etc.
- **Task Management:** Allows users to add new tasks within defined categories. Each task can have a title, an optional description, and a due date.
- **Daily Reminders:** The application sends daily reminders through WhatsApp to users, informing them about tasks that are due soon.
- **Viewing Recent Tasks:** The main page displays a list of tasks created in the last two days, allowing users to stay up to date with recent tasks.
- **Monthly Task Chart:** A graphical display is provided that represents the number of tasks created in the last five months. This helps users get an overview of their productivity over time.
